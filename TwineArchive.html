It hasn&#x27;t been that long since you moved into this new building. The company was looking for somewhere to expand to, and this seemed like the perfect location: 3 floors and a kitchenette on each, already wired with fibre, and the exorcism for this year had already been completed.

But it seems like you see less and less of your colleagues around. The noise from the renovations of the upper floors just won&#x27;t stop -- how can they not be done by now!? At this rate returning to the old office would be a blessing, even if it&#x27;s a little cramped.

You gaze meets your screen and you recoil in surprise -- upon the screen is a manuscript. You eyes flitter over what appears to be the final page -- completed as you woke. Even looking at the final page you know this is the most beautiful thing ever written. A single tear rolls down your cheek.

20 years later you&#x27;re both celebrated and loathed as the writer that ended writing. Your work was so brilliant that nothing more has been written since its publication, but at the same time the world mourns that lack of the written word.

You glance out the window of your ultra-mansion. You have it all, except one thing -- you still wonder about what was going on upstairs in the office that one fateful day. Your super model, Nobel prize winning, world celebrated for their philanthropic deeds life partner asks &quot;What&#x27;s the matter?&quot;. You glance back, &quot;Oh, nothing.&quot;

Peering through the thin strip of window in the door you can&#x27;t make out much. It looks light the in the corridor the door opens into is off, but some of the lights in the adjoining rooms are bleeding into it. As far as you can tell there&#x27;s nothing much going on in the hallway.

Compounding the shock is that where the door release should be there is a set of wires jutting from the wall. Either the release was not properly installed, or has been ripped from the wall.
