But it seems like you see less and less of your colleagues around. The noise from the renovations of the upper floors just won&#x27;t stop -- how can they not be done by now!? At this rate returning to the old office would be a blessing, even if it&#x27;s a little cramped.

20 years later you&#x27;re both celebrated and loathed as the writer that ended writing. Your work was so brilliant that nothing more has been written since its publication, but at the same time the world mourns that lack of the written word.

You glance out the window of your ultra-mansion. You have it all, except one thing -- you still wonder about what was going on upstairs in the office that one fateful day. Your super model, Nobel prize winning, world celebrated for their philanthropic deeds life partner asks &quot;What&#x27;s the matter?&quot;. You glance back, &quot;Oh, nothing.&quot;

An ocean of metal swims between your fingers. Your fingers tighten, trapping a number of tags against your palm. Without so much as a look at the tags, you drop them into your inventory with a delicate clanking.
](else:)[Despite the comfort that carrying dog tags brings you, you reflect upon your personal philosophy: maybe the amount of comfort brought does not scale with the number of tags? It&#x27;s a confusing concept, but it may just be so. You stay your hand for now.

[[Return to the Room-&gt;SecondStoryRightDoor2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name="SecondStoryBarricde" tags="" position="1539,1060">The barricade stands before you. You&#x27;re uncertain as to if its gaudiness is just. Does its excessive confidence speak true? Should it question itself? Does the barricade&#x27;s faith in itself reflect reality? Will none question it based on its extroverted assertion of its ability? Is there an objective quality as distinct from any subjective expression of its own personal ability?

Thick chains wrap the door in a filmic expression of its sheer lockedness. It&#x27;s unclean how the chains achieve the lockedness, but you&#x27;re pretty sure they&#x27;re doing it somehow.

(if: $haveKeyItemBeaker is !0)[Peering into your key item pocket-satchel, you spot the key item beaker. You wonder if this highly mysterious and key to the story item could in some way be used to interact with the barricade. Maybe you could in some way find out?

It&#x27;s a bit of a mystery as to why people are always storing clearly extremely corrosive liquids all over the show. Still, convenient at this moment, so you shan&#x27;t attempt to disbelieve too much, in case your thinking influence the liquid to instead become harmless semi-coagulated jelly.

With a majestic swish of your dominant hand you lease the contents of the vial upon the chains. Another dramatic hiss is elicited as the chains are struck by the fluid. The chains are almost instantly eroded and wilt to the ground with a rather melodramatic series of clangs.

As the echoes of the clangs simmer of off the walls the door the once encased creeks eerily open. You may roll your eyes, it&#x27;s all a little too dramatic, but perhaps there&#x27;s a guilty thrill to that also.

You turn just in time to see the worn stone surrounding the door crumble and fall. You nimbly hop out of the way as the stonework comes collapsing down, barring passage back.

You muse to yourself about the oddness of the building having quote, unquote, stonework. However, it makes sense, it&#x27;s a classy office building. You hard once there are marble floors somewhere, so a bit of stonework isn&#x27;t particularly astray.
