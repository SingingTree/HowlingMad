It feels as though you&#x27;ve been here for $startingDeskHours hours. The noise from the upper floors of the building growing ever more unbearable.

It hasn&#x27;t been that long since you moved into this new building. The company was looking for somewhere to expand to, and this seemed like the perfect location: 3 floors and a kitchenette on each, already wired with fibre, and the exorcism for this year had already been completed.

But it seems like you see less and less of your colleagues around. The noise from the renovations of the upper floors just won&#x27;t stop -- how can they not be done by now!? At this rate returning to the old office would be a blessing, even if it&#x27;s a little cramped.

[[Stairwell&lt;-Continue Into the Stairwell]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="StartingDeskEnding" tags="" position="650,550">The darkness at the corners of your vision encroach further and further as your head swims. Your ears ring and your mouth is dry. Your vision narrows to a pin prick and the ringing intensifies.

You wake to find yourself face down in yourself face down on your keyboard. You lift your head and brush the full stop key with your nose. You gaze meets your screen and you recoil in surprise -- upon the screen is a manuscript. You eyes flitter over what appears to be the final page -- completed as you woke. Even looking at the final page you know this is the most beautiful thing ever written. A single tear rolls down your cheek.

20 years later you&#x27;re both celebrated and loathed as the writer that ended writing. Your work was so brilliant that nothing more has been written since its publication, but at the same time the world mourns that lack of the written word.

You glance out the window of your ultra-mansion. You have it all, except one thing -- you still wonder about what was going on upstairs in the office that one fateful day. Your super model, Nobel prize winning, world celebrated for their philanthropic deeds life partner asks &quot;What&#x27;s the matter?&quot;. You glance back, &quot;Oh, nothing.&quot;

(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[The End]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Stairwell" tags="" position="800,700">There&#x27;s a beep as you press the release for the magnetic lock on the door to the stairwell. You step into the stairwell, the noise from the upper floors ever so louder in here.

You begin ascending the stairs as the door you entered through thuds back into place and the locks reengage. You drudge up the rest stairwell and arrive at the set of doors opening onto the second story.

Peering through the thin strip of window in the door you can&#x27;t make out much. It looks light the in the corridor the door opens into is off, but some of the lights in the adjoining rooms are bleeding into it. As far as you can tell there&#x27;s nothing much going on in the hallway.

The corridor is dimly lit by the light spilling from a couple of rooms to your right, and one to the left. There are many rooms to each side that are either unlit or have their doors closed.

There&#x27;s a musky, somewhat unpleasant smell to the air. Seems like people aren&#x27;t taking care of the place all that well while it&#x27;s being renovated.

With a soft click the lights flicker on.

You gaze down at the switches and recoil in shock -- there&#x27;s smears of something red and rusty over the switches. As the reader, you&#x27;re almost certain that it&#x27;s blood, but as the in game character you&#x27;re not yet sold on the horrors unfolding here.

Compounding the shock is that where the door release should be there is a set of wires jutting from the wall. Either the release was not properly installed, or has been ripped from the wall.

The lights flicker.

The lights in the corridor flicker more violently in jubilation. It is as if your body is comprised entirely of tongues, each licking a 9 volt battery (specifically a transistor battery).

You wake on the floor, the lights in the corridor still appear to be working. You look over at the wires, they appear to have somehow been parted again. They look back at you, and you now know them for what they truly are: imbued with malevolent sentience. You decide it best not to interact with them if they&#x27;re gonna be like this.

A fluorescent bulb dangles from the ceiling, occasionally flickering. The room looks to be some sort of kitchenette. Alarmingly there&#x27;s a body sprawled face down across one of the tables within the room, and a skeleton slumped against one of the walls. Seems like a bad situation.

You consider that it&#x27;s actually kinda hard to categorise the expression of a skeleton given the lack of skin.

You&#x27;re unsure as the the cause of death, given that your degree is in molecular art history, and not forensic calculus, but the skeleton certainly does appear to have belonged to a person who was once alive.
